<div>Hey,</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Your account is involved in a real world trading case (rule 17.2) and has therefore received a trading suspension.</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      17.2: Real world trading items is not allowed either. Both buying and selling is equally punished with a permanent trade restriction of all your accounts. Note: After 60 days, you can apply once
      for an unban request, but all illegal gold or items will be removed.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>We formally accuse you of having made the following illegal trade(s) on your account with the following character(s):</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li><br /></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>â‡’ Total amount:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  <div>We would kindly request a comprehensive breakdown of all these transactions, please provide further details.<br /></div>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Furthermore, please do not attempt to deceive us because any further violations will result in a termination of the ticket conversation and/or higher penalties. Additionally, this ban will not be
  lifted easily, as it is your responsibility to provide strong evidence to prove your innocence.
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      3.14: A proven false statement or lie after receiving a penalty in order to mitigate the penalty may result in an extension of the punishment and possible termination of the ticket conversation.
    </li>
    <li>17.3: You can appeal for Real World Trading bans only showing proofs of your innocence.</li>
    <li>17.5: Faking real world trading proofs will lead to a permanent ban of all your accounts.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Please also note:</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Of course there is evidence, otherwise no bans would have been imposed.</li>
    <li>Evidence is generally not shared with third parties to protect the privacy of reporting players.</li>
    <li>The trade in question, which is declared as a real world trade, may already have taken place several days, weeks or months ago.</li>
    <li>If you have shared your account, you must also bear the consequences and thus this penalty, even if someone else has committed the rule violation on your account.</li>
    <li>Any proven non-accidental involvement in a RWT case may result in a penalty.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
  Moreover, please be aware that this trade restriction is initially permanent. Nevertheless, pursuant to rule 17.2 and its accompanying note, you may submit an unban request once 60 days have elapsed
  from the ban's original issuance. However, [SA]Daveey will decide on that request instead of myself, and a mandatory compensation consisting of the full amount of all illegally traded
  gold/item(s) would be removed during the unbanning process. When it's time, you just need to create a new ticket containing your unban request.<br /><br />
