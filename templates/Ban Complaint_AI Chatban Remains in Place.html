Hey,<br /><br />
<div>
  You were reported via an in-game chat report and then subsequently chat banned automatically for toxicity in your messages according to rule
  1.1 and 3.9:<br />
  <ul>
    <li>1.1: Respect other players! Insulting, trolling and derogatory comments are strictly forbidden.</li>
    <li>
      3.9: Account &amp; Battlemode Chat Ban: Chat-related violations may lead to definite or indefinite account-wide chat bans. Depending on
      where and how the violation occurred, the chat ban may apply either to all chats or only within battlemodes. Bans are issued progressively
      as follows: 3 days → 5 days → 7 days → 14 days → 30 days → 90 days → 180 days. Chat ban history resets if no new chat bans are issued
      within 180 days. In exceptionally severe cases, a permanent chat ban may still be imposed. Note: Ingame chat reports may be processed by an
      unbiased Automated Chat Report System using AI. If you truly believe you were banned unfairly, please open a ticket to appeal.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div><br /></div>
</div>
<div>For more information on how the automatic system works, please refer to the explanation of it at the end of this message.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The relevant report(s) that led to your penalty included the following messages that were deemed problematic and/or toxic:</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>&lt; INSERT CHAT MESSAGES HERE THAT LED TO THE PENALTY &gt;</li>
  </ul>
  <div><br /></div>
</div>
<div>
  <div>
    After manually reviewing this case, we came to the conclusion that the chatban<span
      >&nbsp;will remain in place due to the following reasons:</span

  </ul>

  <span><br /></span>
</div>
<div>
  <div>How does the automatic system work?</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When another player uses the in-game report function on one of your messages, the system automatically analyzes the complete chat logs
        from the relevant conversation and corresponding&nbsp;chat (all chat, normal chat, whisper chat, group chat, guild chat, etc.) within the
        last 30 minutes of the reported message.
      </li>
      <li>
        To ensure full context, the analyzed chatlog contains not only your messages but also those of every other player who spoke during that
        period. This allows the system to account for the circumstances in which your potentially toxic message was sent and to consider any
        mitigating factors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before analysis begins, the entire chatlog is fully anonymized. This prevents any bias based on who wrote the messages. The system
        evaluates only what was said, not who said it or whether that person has prior violations.
      </li>
      <li>
        The analysis produces a numerical toxicity score assigned to you for that specific report. If the system finds no wrongdoing, the score
        will be 0, effectively voiding the report.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your overall toxicity score accumulates over time. Each non-zero score from an individual report remains active for 30 days, after which
        it expires and is removed from your total. If your accumulated score ever exceeds a certain threshold, the system automatically issues a
        penalty, either an account-wide chat ban or a battlemode chat ban, depending on where the most recent violation took place. The duration
        of the penalty is determined solely by your previous infractions (as outlined in rule 3.9), not by the severity of the latest violation.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have been chat-banned within the last 30 days, the threshold for triggering a new penalty is temporarily halved. This is intended
        to discourage repeat offenses by making subsequent penalties easier to trigger.
      </li>
      <li>
        The toxicity threshold needed to trigger a penalty is subject to change and will not be publicly communicated for now until we have
        finetuned the system to the point where we believe it to be final.
      </li>
    </ul>
